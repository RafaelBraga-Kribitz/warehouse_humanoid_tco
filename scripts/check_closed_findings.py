"""Adversary core — re-run every closed finding's verification_script.

Run by `make verify` and (Phase 4) by a clean-checkout CI job. For each finding
with status `closed`, execute its verification_script and require exit 0. A
non-zero result is a regression: the finding was declared fixed but its contract
no longer holds. This is the mechanism that makes closure durable rather than a
narrative claim.

`closed_historical` findings are archival records and may carry a null script;
they are skipped.
