"""Shared ratchet helper for finding verification tests.

Each tests/governance/test_fNNN_*.py is the `verification_script` for finding
F-NNN. It asserts the *fixed* (post-remediation) state, but follows the same
ratchet as the check_*.py scripts:

  finding closed / closed_historical  -> a still-broken condition FAILS (regression)
  finding open / in_progress          -> a still-broken condition xfails (known gap)

This keeps the suite green while Phases 1-5 are in flight, yet the moment a
finding is marked closed its test starts guarding against regression. The
Adversary (scripts/check_closed_findings.py) runs these via pytest on every PR.
